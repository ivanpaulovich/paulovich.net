As an Agile .NET developer with background on Hexagonal and Clean architectures I enjoy implementing solutions based on use cases and decoupled from technology details. 

As an evangelist of Evolutionary Architecture I am interested in designing software which keeps the development speed high  over time.

As a Software Craftsman I practice my programming skills and disciplines of TDD and Design Patterns on a daily basis and I see the software development as a collaborative process in which I do mentoring and coaching.

At the same time I am up to date with the technology trends of .NET Core, Docker, Microservices and Cloud. I share on GitHub real world implementations of Domain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing, CQRS, SOLID and Microservices. Checkout @ivanpaulovich on GitHub.
